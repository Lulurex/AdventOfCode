Advent of Code Dec programming
This is my python project that I'm doing in my free time to use the Python I used in highschool and solidify my skills in it. 
As of starting this, I know about basic loops and lists and arrays. 

As I'm going along I've learned about sets, dictionaries, O(n) Time complexity, O(k) Space Complexity, Regex. 
I've also heard about maps, recursion, graphs and trees but haven't implemented them.
